# Pomodoro Timer

A visual pomodoro Timer for focused work.

This program uses the standard Pomodoro technique time increments of 25 min focus mode with 5 min break, and one 20 min break.
Apart from the standard timer, the app uses graphic assets to track progress: different stages of tomato plant to track progress within individual focus intervals, and small tomatoes as counters for completed focus intervals.


Sound effect to alert when individual intervals are completed is also available.

UI created with Python's Tkinter.

# How to Run

You need to have python interpreter installed. Download the folder and unzip, in terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) type "python main.py".

Additionally, you also need to have the simpleaudio module installed. Alternatively, you can remove lines 3, 44, and 91 to remove the sound.
